## 🚀 Featured Project

### Community Detection Algorithms Visualizer

A sophisticated JavaFX application that visualizes and compares four fundamental community detection algorithms, demonstrating advanced expertise in algorithm design and data visualization.

**🔬 Algorithms Implemented:**
- **Louvain Method** - Hierarchical modularity optimization (O(n log n))
- **Girvan-Newman** - Edge betweenness-based clustering (O(m²n))
- **Label Propagation** - Fast diffusion-based approach (O(m))
- **Clique Percolation** - Overlapping community detection (NP-hard)

**🎯 Key Features:**
- Real-time algorithm execution visualization
- Interactive graph manipulation
- Performance metrics and time complexity analysis
- Step-by-step algorithm progression
- Clean, professional UI/UX design

**🛠️ Tech Stack:** Java, JavaFX, Graph Theory, Algorithm Design, Data Visualization

### DevOps Project – Java Sprint Boot Application Deployment and CI/CD pipeline implementation
Full CI/CD pipeline implementation using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes with automated build/deployment processes.

**Tech Stack:** Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, SonarQube, Grafana,Prometheus

## 🎯 Personal Philosophy

> "I see technology as a dialogue between mind and world—a way to wrest meaning from complexity. In that fragile balance between ideas and implementation, I craft order from chaos, believing—as Dostoevsky taught—that meaning emerges through struggle. Every line of code is part of that search."
