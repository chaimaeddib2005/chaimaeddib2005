## 🎯 Personal Philosophy

> *“I see technology as a dialogue between mind and world — a way to wrest meaning from complexity.  
> In the fragile balance between ideas and implementation, I craft order from chaos, believing — as Dostoevsky taught — that meaning emerges through struggle.  
> Every line of code is part of that search.”*
